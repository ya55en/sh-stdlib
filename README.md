# posix-sh

Stdlib for posix-compatible shells.

We needed a sort of stdlib for POSIX-compatible Bourne Shell and couldn't
find one, so we decided to set this project up.

## Status

This project is an alpha (very preliminary!) state of development.


## Modules

Currently, we have initial versions of:

- sys
- os
- logging
- string
- path
- unittest

## Known issues

Lots of things to do and improve! ;)
